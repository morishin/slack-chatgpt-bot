## Setup

Before getting started, make sure you have a development workspace where you
have permissions to install apps. If you don’t have one set up, go ahead and
[create one](https://slack.com/create). Also, please note that the workspace
requires any of [the Slack paid plans](https://slack.com/pricing).

### Install the Slack CLI

To use this sample, you first need to install and configure the Slack CLI.
Step-by-step instructions can be found in our
[Quickstart Guide](https://api.slack.com/future/quickstart).

## Running Your Project Locally

Make `.env` and `.env.ts` files and fill values.

```sh
$ cp .env.example .env
$ cp .env.ts.example .env.ts
```

While building your app, you can see your changes propagated to your workspace
in real-time with `slack run`. In both the CLI and in Slack, you'll know an app
is the development version if the name has the string `(dev)` appended.

```zsh
# Run app locally
$ SLACK_APP_NAME="gpt-bot" SLACK_APP_DISPLAY_NAME="bot" slack run

Connected, awaiting events
```

Once running, click the
[previously created Shortcut URL](#create-a-link-trigger) associated with the
`(dev)` version of your app. This should start the included sample workflow.

To stop running locally, press `<CTRL> + C` to end the process.

## Deploying Your App

Once you're done with development, you can deploy the production version of your
app to Slack hosting using `slack deploy`:

```zsh
$ SLACK_APP_NAME="gpt-bot" SLACK_APP_DISPLAY_NAME="bot" slack deploy
```

After deploying, [create a new link trigger](#create-a-link-trigger) for the
production version of your app (not appended with `(dev)`). Once the trigger is
invoked, the workflow should run just as it did in when developing locally.

### Viewing Activity Logs

Activity logs for the production instance of your application can be viewed with
the `slack activity` command:

```zsh
$ slack activity
```

## Project Structure

### `manifest.ts`

The [app manifest](https://api.slack.com/future/manifest) contains the app's
configuration. This file defines attributes like app name and description.

### `slack.json`

Used by the CLI to interact with the project's SDK dependencies. It contains
script hooks that are executed by the CLI and implemented by the SDK.

### `/functions`

[Functions](https://api.slack.com/future/functions) are reusable building blocks
of automation that accept inputs, perform calculations, and provide outputs.
Functions can be used independently or as steps in workflows.

### `/workflows`

A [workflow](https://api.slack.com/future/workflows) is a set of steps that are
executed in order. Each step in a workflow is a function.

Workflows can be configured to run without user input or they can collect input
by beginning with a [form](https://api.slack.com/future/forms) before continuing
to the next step.

### `/triggers`

[Triggers](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers) determine when workflows are
executed. A trigger file describes a scenario in which a workflow should be run,
such as a user pressing a button or when a specific event occurs.
